# Power BI Dashboard Project

This repository documents the step-by-step process of building a Power BI dashboard.
---

## Step 1: Define the Objective
- Identify the business question/problem.
- Decide what kind of insights the dashboard should provide.
- Define the key KPIs and metrics to be analyzed.
    * **Total sales**: the overall revenue generated from all items sold.
    * **Average sales**: the avarage revenue per sale.
    * **Number of items**: the total count of items sold.
    * **Avarage rating**: the avarage cistomer rating for item sold.

## Step 3:  Data Transformation (Power Query)
- Data Cleaning & Preparation
- Remove duplicates, handle missing values.
- Standardize column names.

---

## Step 4: Data Modeling (is not done in this project)
- Define relationships between tables.
- Build a star schema where possible.

## Step 5: DAX Calculations
- Write measures using DAX (e.g., totals, averages, percentages).
- Implement KPIs with conditional formatting.

---

## Step 6: Dashboard Design
- Design the structure of the dashboard.
- Decide chart placements, filters, and navigation.
- Add charts (bar, line, pie, etc.).
- Apply consistent formatting and color schemes.
- Add slicers/filters for interactivity.
- Assemble all charts and visuals into a complete dashboard.
- Add text boxes, titles, and navigation buttons.

## Step 7: Insights Generation
- Interpret the visuals to generate insights.
- Highlight key findings and recommendations.

## Documentation & Updates
- Keep track of each step and changes made.
- Update README as the dashboard evolves.
